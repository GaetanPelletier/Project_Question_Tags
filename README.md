# Project_Question_Tags
This is an educational project.

The aim of this project was to discover the basics of *NLP*.

Deep learning is not used. Instead, we discovered algorithms like *TF-IDF* or *LDA*.

In addition, we learned how to perform multilabel classification.

Finally, an application was deployed using Flask and Heroku: https://gp-iml-project5-tags.herokuapp.com/
